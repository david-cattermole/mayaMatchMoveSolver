Installation
============

To install **mmSolver** on your personal computer, follow the install
instructions below.

Alternatively to install in a large company environment needing
configuration options make sure to follow the `INSTALL.md
<https://github.com/david-cattermole/mayaMatchMoveSolver/blob/master/INSTALL.md>`_
file.

Install Maya Module
-------------------

**mmSolver** can be installed by un-zipping the archive (`.zip` or
`.tar.gz`) file, and copying the contents into the following directory
on your computer:

On Windows::

   C:\Users\<Your User Name>\My Documents\maya\<Maya Version>\modules

On Linux::

   ~/maya/<Maya Version>/modules

You may need to create the 'modules' directory manually, as it is not
created default by Maya.

You should now have one file and one directory like this::

   <maya user directory>/2017/modules/mayaMatchMoveSolver-0.1.0-maya2017-win64.mod (module file)
   <maya user directory>/2017/modules/mayaMatchMoveSolver-0.1.0-maya2017-win64 (directory)

You can open Maya as normal and the tool will be recognised
automatically at start-up.  You will see a message in the Script
Editor '# root : MM Solver Startup... #', a new shelf and menu will
automatically be created for you named 'mmSolver'.


Load mmSolver in Maya 2022
--------------------------

Loading custom plug-ins in Maya 2022+ has been changed to increase
security and avoid viruses, as a result mmSolver has needed to change
slightly. Previous versions of Maya should still work exactly as
before.

To load mmSolver in Maya 2022 you must run the following MEL command::

   mmsolver_load

This will load the mmSolver plug-in, and allow you to automatically
load the mmSolver plug-in and will ensure it is loaded each time Maya
is started.

If you wish to unload mmSolver so it will not be loaded at Maya
start-up run the following MEL command::

   mmsolver_unload

These commands added in mmSolver v0.3.16 were added to work-around the
Maya 2022+ Security preferences and ensure mmSolver will be loaded
when it's needed.

Additionally the Python module `mmSolver.startup` was added, and
allows pipelines to manually load mmSolver with the Python commands::

   import mmSolver.startup
   mmSolver.startup.mmsolver_startup()

Rather than using the `mmsolver_load` or `mmsolver_unload` commands,
optionally you can load the mmSolver plug-in via the menu `Windows >
Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager` window. This will also load
the mmSolver tools automatically when the plug-in is loaded. If you
wish to load mmSolver each time Maya is started you may enable
"autoload" via the Plug-in Manager to ensure the mmSolver tools,
shelves, menus and plug-in are always loaded.

Install 3DEqualizer Files
-------------------------

To install the 3DEqualizer (3DE) tools for **mmSolver**, follow the steps below.

The 3DEqualizer tools are for integration into workflows using 3DEqualizer.

.. list-table:: 3DEqualizer Tools
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File Name
     - Tool Name

   * - copy_track_mmsolver.py
     - Copy 2D Tracks (MM Solver)

   * - export_track_mmsolver.py
     - Export 2D Tracks (MM Solver)...

   * - import_track_mmsolver.py
     - Import 2D Tracks (MM Solver)...

   * - paste_camera_mmsolver.py
     - Paste Camera (MM Solver)...

Script Database
---------------

For 3DEqualizer versions supporting the online
`Script Database <https://www.3dequalizer.com/?site=scriptdb>`_, you may
install the latest tools via the menu '3DE4 > Python > ScriptDB Installer'.

See this `video tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVr_Fo1xh0E>`_
for an example of installing scripts with ScriptDB.

Home Directory
--------------

Alternatively, you may install scripts manually by copying the
3DEqualizer python scripts in the `3dequalizer` sub-directory into the
`~/.3dequalizer/py_scripts` directory.

On Linux::

   $ cd <module directory>
   $ cp ./3dequalizer/* ~/.3dequalizer/py_scripts

On Windows::

   > CD <module directory>
   > XCOPY 3dequalizer\* "%AppData%\.3dequalizer\py_scripts" /Y

Install SynthEyes Files
-----------------------

To install the SynthEyes tools for **mmSolver**, copy the files inside
the `<module root>/syntheyes` directory, into the custom SynthEyes
script directory.

On Windows::

   > CD <module directory>
   > XCOPY syntheyes\* "%AppData%\SynthEyes\scripts" /Y

For example, this path::

   C:\Users\<Your User Name>\AppData\Roaming\SynthEyes\scripts

The tool can be accessed as a standard export script in the menu
`File > Export > Trackers (mmSolver)`. This tool will export all
Tracks in the scene as .uv file format, ready to be imported into
mmSolver.

Install Blender Add-On
----------------------

Starting with mmSolver v0.3.15 a Blender Add-On (.zip file) is
included in the 'blender' directory of mmSolver.

If you wish to use Blender's 2D tracking features along with mmSolver
please see the documentation for :ref:`installation and usage tips <copy-blender-2d-tracks-ref>`.
