Hotkeys
=======

Define the hotkeys and hotkey related tools for mmSolver.

Change Hotkey Set
-----------------

On the mmSolver shelf is a dynamic-drop-down menu to quickly switch
the currently active Hotkey Set. This tool will not just work with
mmSolver hotkeys, but instead it will work with all hotkey sets.

While using this tool, the user will not need to open the Maya Hotkey
Editor to change the Hotkey Set.

Default Hotkeys
---------------

Inside the *mmSolver* hotkey set there are default hotkeys. The
default hotkeys are provided as helping shortcuts to speed up the
workflow with mmSolver.

The **A** key invokes a catch-all tool capiable of performing many
common tasks without needing to move your mouse away from the
viewport.
