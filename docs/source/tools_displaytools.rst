Display Tools
=============

The tools on this page are not specific to Markers, Cameras or
Bundles, but are general tools useful in Maya for many different
tasks.

.. _center-2d-on-selection-tool-ref:

Center 2D On Selection
----------------------

Forces the active viewport camera to lock itâ€™s center to the currently
selected transform node. The Center 2D window can be used to offset
the 2D offset horizontally/vertically.

While centering is turned on, it overrides Maya's normal 2D Pan/Zoom
settings.

.. note:: A viewport camera can only center on one node at a time.

Usage to *apply* the centering effect:

1) Select transform node.

2) Activate a 3D viewport.

3) Run 'Apply 2D Center' tool.

   - The active viewport camera will be centered on the selected
     transform node.

4) Use the Pan/Zoom tool (default hotkey is backslash (' \\ ') key),
   to zoom in and out. Play the Maya timeline and use the centered view as
   needed.

5) Click on the 'Apply 2D Center' menu option box to display the
   'Center 2D Offset' window.

   - Drag the Horizontal, Vertical and Zoom sliders to offset the 2D centering.

   - Click 'Apply' button to apply the Center 2D.

   - Click 'Remove' button to remove the Center 2D.

   - Click 'Reset Offset' button to reset all the 2D offsets.

   - Click 'Close' button to close the window.

Usage to *remove* centering effect:

1) Run 'Remove 2D Center' tool.

   - The active viewport will no longer center on an object, but will
     not reset the view.

   - The pan/zoom will still be active. To reset the viewport camera,
     turn off Pan/Zoom on the viewport camera (default hotkey is
     backslash (' \\ ') key).

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.centertwodee.tool as tool

    # Apply Centering onto active camera
    tool.main()

    # Remove Centering from active camera
    tool.remove()


.. _toggle-viewport-node-types-ref:

Toggle Viewport Node Types
--------------------------

There are a range of `Toggle Viewport *` tools that are used to
hide/show groups of node types.

Node type groups include:

- Show/Hide geometry in the current viewport.

- Show/Hide Locators and NURBS Curves in the current viewport.

- Show/Hide Image Planes in the current viewport.

Usage:

1) Activate a 3D Viewport.

2) Run tool.

   - The node type visibility will be shown/hidden based on the
     current visibility.

Each different group can be activated with a slightly different Python
command.


Toggle Viewport Geometry (Mesh, NURBS, etc):

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.toggleviewportgeom.tool as tool
    tool.main()


Toggle Viewport Controls: (Locators, Curves, etc)

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.toggleviewportctrls.tool as tool
    tool.main()


Toggle Viewport Image Planes (Maya native and MM solver image planes):

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.toggleviewportimgplns.tool as tool
    tool.main()


Alternatively, a user can construct their own custom scripts to
control visibility like so:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.utils.viewport as viewport_utils
    model_panel = viewport_utils.get_active_model_panel()
    if model_panel:
        value = viewport_utils.get_locator_visibility(model_panel)
        new_value = not value
        viewport_utils.set_locator_visibility(model_panel, new_value)


See :ref:`mmSolver.utils.viewport <mmsolver-utils-viewport-ref>`
Python module documentation for more help.

.. _set-mesh-hold-outs-ref:

Set Mesh Hold-Outs
------------------

This tool is used to force mesh nodes to be rendered as hold-out in
the viewport, or not.

This is similar to assigning a `useBackground` shader, to geometry,
however this tool avoids the need to create a shader, and manage
assignments.

The tool is split into different individual features which are fairly
self-explanatory:

- Enable / Disable Hold-Outs on *selected* meshes.

- Enable / Disable Hold-Outs on *all* Meshes in the scene.

Usage:

1) Select meshes (optional)

2) Run tool.

   - Meshes will be have the Hold-Out attribute enabled / disabled.


Each different feature can be activated with a slightly different Python
command.

Enable Hold-outs on Selected Meshes:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.setmesholdouts.tool as tool
    tool.enable_selected_meshes()


Disable Hold-outs on Selected Meshes:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.setmesholdouts.tool as tool
    tool.disable_selected_meshes()


Enable Hold-outs on All Meshes:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.setmesholdouts.tool as tool
    tool.enable_all_meshes()


Disable Hold-outs on All Meshes:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.setmesholdouts.tool as tool
    tool.disable_all_meshes()


.. _create-sky-dome-tool-ref:

Create Horizon / Axis Dome / Sky Dome
--------------------------------------

`MM Solver` includes a flexible `Sky Dome` node that can be used to
visualize the rotations of a camera with lines.

Simply create the `Sky Dome`, `Axis Dome` or `Horizon` to create a
``mmSkyDomeShape`` node, then you can edit the attributes in the
Attribute Editor.

- Set the `Draw Mode` and `Radius` attributes to control how the depth
  of Sky Dome.

- Set the `Alpha` and `Line Width` attributes to easily adjust the
  brightness of the lines.

- Enable Anti-Aliasing in Maya Viewport 2.0 to see the lines with
  better quality.

- By default the centre of the Sky Dome will always be positioned to
  your visible camera - it will "dynamically attach" to your camera in
  each viewport.

- The `Sky Dome` is not renderable in software renders (like Arnold),
  it only supports Viewport 2.0.

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.createskydome.tool
    import mmSolver.tools.createskydome.constant as const

    # Create Sky Dome
    mmSolver.tools.createskydome.tool.main(preset_name=const.PRESET_SKY_DOME_NAME)

    # Create Axis Dome
    mmSolver.tools.createskydome.tool.main(preset_name=const.PRESET_AXIS_DOME_NAME)

    # Create Horizon Line
    mmSolver.tools.createskydome.tool.main(preset_name=const.PRESET_HORIZON_LINE_NAME)

.. _set-object-colour-tool-ref:

Set Object Colour / Reset Object Colour
---------------------------------------

The `Set Object Colour` tools can be used to override the wireframe
colour of the selected objects.

Likewise to remove the colour overrides, use the `Reset Object Colour`
to reset selected objects.

This tool works on common Maya shape nodes, such as `Meshes`, `NURBS
Surfaces`, and `NURBS Curves`, as well as MM Solver shape nodes, like
`Markers`, `Bundles` and `Lines`.

.. figure:: images/tools_set_object_colour_ui.png
    :alt: Set Object Colour UI
    :align: center
    :width: 60%

.. note:: Starting with Maya 2023 the Set Object Colour UI contains an
    Alpha channel value, allowing the wireframe to be transparent.


Usage - *Set Colour*:

1) Select object(s).

2) Run tool.

   - Choose colour.

   - Move mouse away from window to set and close the colour.


Usage - *Reset Colour*:

1) Select object(s).

2) Run tool.

   - All selected objects have colour overrides removed back to
     default colours.


To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.setobjectcolour.tool as tool
    tool.open_mini_window()

    # Or run with the larger window.
    tool.open_window()

    # Or reset the colour on selected objects.
    tool.reset_colour()


.. _toggle-object-motion-trail-tool-ref:

Toggle Object Motion Trail
--------------------------

The `Object Motion Trail` can be used to view the position of a 3D
transform (or object) for a series of frames, using a line. This tool
can be used to toggle the `Motion Trail` to easily create and view.


Usage:

1) Select Object transform node(s).

2) Run tool.

   - If the object has no motion trail, the motion trail will be
     created or unhidden.

   - If the object has a motion trail it will be hidden.


To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.toggleobjectmotiontrail.tool as tool
    tool.main()


.. _create-screen-space-motion-trail-tool-ref:

Create Screen-Space Motion Trail
--------------------------------

The Screen-Space Motion Trail tool creates a non-editable curve that
shows the screen-space position of a transform across multiple frames.

With default options the tool can be used to visualise the shutter
time of a Marker (or any other transform), assuming a shutter angle of
180 degrees (half a frame).

The user may change the default options after the motion trail is
created by selecting the Motion Trail node under the camera and
editing the attributes in the Channel Box.

Beware of small *increment* values, and large frame ranges. These will
cause slow-downs in the playback of the Maya scene.

.. list-table:: Motion Trail Attributes
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Type
     - Description

   * - Use Frame Range
     - On/Off
     - Use the frame range, or the pre/post-frame values.

   * - Pre-Frame
     - Number
     - The number of frames to display before the current frame.

   * - Post-Frame
     - Number
     - The number of frames to display after the current frame.

   * - Frame Range Start
     - Number
     - The starting frame number, if Use Frame Range is on.

   * - Frame Range Start
     - Number
     - The ending frame number, if Use Frame Range is on.

   * - Increment
     - Number
     - The increment for each sample of the motion trail.

Usage:

1) Select transform nodes.

2) Activate viewport.

3) Run tool.

4) A temporary null is created (required for the tool to work), and a
   motion trail parented under the camera is created.

To run the tool, use this Python command:

.. code:: python

    import mmSolver.tools.screenspacemotiontrail.tool as tool
    tool.main()
