# External Dependencies

This file directory contains external dependencies to mmSolver.

You may run individual build or download scripts, however running from
the project root will be easier.

For example:
```commandline
$ cd <project root>
$ bash scripts/build_mmSolverLibs_linux_maya2018.bash
$ bash scripts/build_mmSolver_linux_maya2018.bash
```
